              Zandig Knowledge Management Foundation Since 2012
            </h2>
            <p id="p">
              Zandig Knowledge Management Foundation was conceptualized and created on 12th July 2012.
            It is a non-profit organization to empower girls and make them economically and socially
        independent, especially in India. We support underprivileged girls with school fees to reduce
      the financial burden on their families. We also encourage and nurture deserving and needy students 
     through scholarships to pursue higher education. We help to upgrade the infrastructure and resources at 
     local schools to help create a better learning environment for children. Our motto is to empower by connecting
     children in known communities referred by the sponsors.
              <br />
              We encourage all the sponsors to get involved and directly 
    connect with the sponsored children from your communities.
    In the academic year 2019-20, we supported about 50 girl students
     in various states in India such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka,
       Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. The children range from elementary 
      school to graduation. One student is aspiring to study in IIT JEE. 
      We donated to flood-affected citizens and also supported COVID-affected 
      families in these strange times. Zandig Foundation is established as a 
        Non-Profit Organization. All your contributions are tax-deductible.

                  could prove to be our greatest asset. Education contributes

                  Buildings, classrooms, laboratories, and equipment -
                  educational infrastructure - are essential elements of the
                  learning environment in schools and universities. There is
                  strong evidence that high-quality infrastructure facilitates
                  better teaching, improves student achievement, and reduces
                  early school leaving rates, among other benefits.Thus Zandig
                  Knowledge Management Foundation help to upgrade the
                  infrastructure and resources at local schools to help create a
                  better learning environment for children.

            <p>
              We have lost two our biggest supporters and cheerleaders the past

                year

              As we are in the last stretch of the pandemic, these familes are
              still struggling to bring their lives back on track. Even though
              parents care deeply for their girls, a limited household income
              can deter them from prioritzing their daugther's education. This
              pandemic has disrupted all our lives, and these girls and families
              need our help now more than ever. Our girls' parents are still
              struggling to make ends meet due to the COVID for the past couple
              of years and have already started reaching out to us for next
              academic year support. Your contribution will make a huge
              difference while their parents are facing an uncertain furture and
              new challenges. We hope you will continue to support them and make
              a positive impact in their lives.
